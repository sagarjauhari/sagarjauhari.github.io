I had some problems installing the Netbeans IDE 6.5 on Ubuntu Intrepid.
After running the file netbeans-6.5-python-linux.sh in the terminal,
there was an error:\
\
net beans lexical error or unexpected token, expected valid token\
\
If you are facing similar problems, refer to earlier post :\
[JAVA Swing and AWT applications freezing in
Ubuntu](http://technolark.blogspot.com/2008/11/swing-applications-freezing-in-ubuntu.html)\
The solution to this problem is the same as mentioned in the above post.
Though I had been using Netbeans 6.1, the configuration had changed
somehow! Anyways, after following the instructions, the problem should
get solved.\

Happy Netbean-ing ..
