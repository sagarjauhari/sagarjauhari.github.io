I found a way to install the adobe flash plugin on my ubuntu box. Till
now I was trying to install the .deb package from the adobe site which
is named as (ubuntu 8.04+ ) and it alway got installed but never worked!
So here's a way:\

1.  Download
    this[package](http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/install_flash_player_10_linux.tar.gz).
2.  Close your firefox.\
3.  Open it with your archive manager and extract it in you home
    directory.
4.  Open a terminal and type:
    \$\~/install\_flash\_player\_10\_linux/flashplayer-installer
5.  Follow the instructions and do a 'yes' when it says that the plugin
    will be installed in your home directory in the .mozilla folder.

Done! :)
