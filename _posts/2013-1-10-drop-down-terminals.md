I like drop down terminals. They're something I can't live without.
Since a lot of time I had been using the Gnome shell extension
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/442/drop-down-terminal/ but Gnome
shell extensions, though great and light weight, are a bit unreliable at
this time. They cause trouble almost always after every distribution
upgrade, Firefox upgrade or gnome shell upgrade. Its all the more
troublesome since Firefox shifted to rapid updates. \

 A good alternative is [Guake](http://guake.org/). Gives a lot of
customization, and does what it says. But I don't want any
customization. I want just a simple, fast, reliable terminal whose sole
purpose is to drop down when commanded to. So, I've stripped Guake of
all the customization. Lets see how long it says loyal.
