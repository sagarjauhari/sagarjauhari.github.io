================

**Prizes worth Rs. 63,000 to be won\
**

The cyber world is all around us, ever evolving, ever changing.
Programmers InQ, the series of events in Quark 2010 related to the
cyberspace, ensure that you get the opportunity to be the agents of this
change. From the no-holds-barred ingenuity of Binary Pirates to the
stringent protocol of The Ultimate Coder, along with the adaptability of
Rip Open, Programmers InQ promises to not only be breathtaking in its
simplicity and its knowledge, but also a source for the best Tech minds
of the country to compete in a forum that is truly fitting to the genius
of todayâ€™s techno-savvy youth.

**The race to the top . . .**

The holy grail for hackers from across the country, Binary Pirates has
just one rule- THERE ARE NO RULES. Do whatever it takes to capture the
'flag' and move to the next level. The event will test your
understanding of networking principles and web technologies and your
ability to bend them to suit your needs. In short, this event will shake
the very foundations of your hacking knowledge and your ingenuity.

-----------------------------------------------------

Confound 'Em.

Sick of those cascading tabs and well-behaved braces? It's time you
break the shackles and let loose the spaghetti coder inside! With
creativity and a taste for technical insanity being the only
pre-requisites, arm yourself to take on your twisted binary counterparts
in the arena to obfuscate, brain-fuck, reverse engineer and whirl your
way to victory.

[RIP OPEN](http://www.bits-quark.org/rip_open) {style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-size: 18px; "}
----------------------------------------------

**Online Round 1** of Rip Open will start on **10th January, 2010** at
**00:01 hrs** and will end on **12th January, 2010** at **23:59 hrs**

Open source development as you never thought existed. This event is for
those who believe in the power of the open source. This event is all
about the constantly evolving world of open source where people with
innovative ideas get together, share their resources and bring out
totally new creations using resources someone else created before them.
The final output is all that matters, so if you think you have the
logical and analytical skills, then this is the event for you.

[Terminator 1.0](http://www.bits-quark.org/terminator) {style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-size: 18px; "}
------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever wondered how codes work behind the scenes from the machine
level? If your answer is YES, then register for this event ! You will
surely enjoy and learn.

Terminator 1.0 is an assembly language coding competition. Higher level
languages are very prominent in popular coding competitions but unlike
them, this event explores the limitless possibilities in assembly
language coding and brings the participants closer to what happens
behind the scenes! The advantage of assembly language is that the
participants do not have to remember any syntax as there are limited
commands and statements. All that matters is their logic and reasoning
power.

[Code JAM](http://www.bits-quark.org/code_jam) {style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-size: 18px; "}
----------------------------------------------

A technical festival without a coding competition sounds incomplete.
Doesn't it!\
So here is a chance for everyone to brush up their minds for a
challenging programming contest with the freedom of coding in whatever
language they want.
