The GUI doesn't load, shows a crappy binary screen with hell lot of
cursors !\
\
Possible\
Solution: 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg'\
\
\
 Now, this was the problem I was facing since the last 5 days, and had
to resort to the use of\
Windows to read the lecture slides coz the tests are on.\
Research: I logged in via the recovery mode (as root) and tried the
'startx', 'x', and other X server\
commands, but in vain.... everytime the shitty screen came up instead of
the cool blue login screen.\
I used to log out of the X server mode using 'CTRL+ALT+ BACK SPACE', and
the following log\
used to be displayed in the root terminal:\
-----------------------------------------------------------------\
X window System Version 1.3.0\
Reles Date: 19 April 2007\
X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0, Realease 1.3\
Build Operating System: Linux Ubuntu(xorg-server
2:1.3.3.3.dfsg-12ubuntu8.3)\
Current operating system: Linux sa...... 2.6.22-14-generic \#1 SMP Tue

using file: /etc/X11/Xorg.conf\
.\
.\
(EE) AIGLX: Screen 0 is not DRI capable\
xinit": connection to X server lost.\
waiting for X server to shut down FreeFontPath: FPE\
"user/share/fonts/X11/misc"\
refcount is 2, should be 1, fixing.\
Now, I checked the mentioned Xorg.conf file, and everything seemed
pretty perfect! After 5 days of\
messing around here and there, I finally found the solution (though I
still don't know the reason why\
the hell it occured). I again viewed the Xorg.conf file in less and
found some comments how to\
reconfigure it. The xorg.conf file looks like this:\
\# xorg.conf (xorg X Window System server configuration file)\
\#\
\# This file was generated by dexconf, the Debian X Configuration\
tool, using\
\# values from the debconf database.\
\#\
\# Edit this file with caution, and see the xorg.conf manual page.\
\# (Type "man xorg.conf" at the shell prompt.)\
\#\
\# This file is automatically updated on xserver-xorg package\
upgrades \*only\*\
\# if it has not been modified since the last upgrade of the\
xserver-xorg\
\# package.\
\#\
\# If you have edited this file but would like it to be\
automatically updated\
\# again, run the following command:\
\# sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg\
Section "Files"\
EndSection\
Section "InputDevice"\
 Identifier "Generic Keyboard"\
 Driver "kbd"\
 Option "CoreKeyboard"\
..\
.\
.\
.\
.\
And I tried reconfigure it, and VOILA ! i am writing this using
Open-office doc !(obviously in my GUI).\

Happy researching
