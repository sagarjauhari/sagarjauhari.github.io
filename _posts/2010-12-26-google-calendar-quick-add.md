Often in Google Calendar, quick add can prove to be very helpful and
more importantly - fast. With intelligent keyword and context matching
it'll make things faster when we're to add a bulk of events spread over
a range of dates. The best part comes with recurring events - we dont'
have to click on 'edit event details', check the 'repeats' check box and
select how the event repeats! With 'quick add' we can simply schedule a
repeating event as:\

> Birthday Manu 7 May repeats yearly

Â or\

> have medicine 9pm repeat daily for 2 weeks

Google calendar will intelligently parse the above comments and schedule
the event/reminders accordingly.\

add can also be seamlessly integrated into your application using the
