I was wondering if there's something like a private 'google sidewiki' in
which the entries are not actually published but are synced with your
account and the notes/anecdotes are shown the next time 'you' visit that
page. Some Firefox/Chrome plugins do give that support but the problem
is localization of your information. All your notes etc. on webpages are
visible only on the browser and not available elsewhere.
