Well, I saw many people having problem with Thunderbird not wrapping
text at the default set 72 chars. Huh, I figured out the solution. The
edit/options \>preferences \> composition \> general tab has an entry
box saying\
"wrap plain text messages at \_\_ characters"\
\
the default set is 72 characters. Now what happens is that most of the
mails that we send are HTML or 'unknown' by default. And the entry box
says "plain text" not HTML. So, go to the most frequently mailed
addresses in your addressbook in thunderbird and select 'plain' text
message as the default in the contact details for each. :) it was not a
problem, it was just obvious !! \
